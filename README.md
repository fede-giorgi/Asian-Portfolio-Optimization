# ECON 424 Group Project

## Overview
This project conducts a financial analysis of four Asian market ETFs (EWS - Singapore, EWY - South Korea, EWT - Taiwan, EWH - Hong Kong) using data from 2015â€“2025. Through sample statistics, log returns, and risk measures (VaR), we assess asset performance and build efficient portfolios under different constraints.

## Key Takeaways
- EWT is the overall best performing asset
- The portfolio exhibits low expected return (Highest 9.54%) and low sharpe ratio
- Little diversification benefits since all assets have high levels of positive correlation with each other 
- High Standard Error for expected return but stable Standard Error for SD
